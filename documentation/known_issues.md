# Known Issues:

## Active Bugs
- When sprinting some placements are missed
- All patterns will build below the player's feet, for things like walls/tunnels the expected behaviour is to build "around" the player as long as an air pocket is left for them to run.

## Backlog / UX Improvements
- Invalid block codes in patterns fail silently - should show in-game chat notification when a block doesn't exist or can't be placed

## Fixed
- ~~The reload command (`.pb reload`) crashes the game to desktop~~ - Fixed by clean DLL reinstall
